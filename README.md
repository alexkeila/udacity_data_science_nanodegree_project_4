# Data Science Nanodegree - Project 1: Write a Data Science Blog Post

This project is related to the Data Science Nanodegree on Udacity (https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd025/dashboard/overview)

I have also written a post at Medium describing this project and the results. It can be accessed [here](https://medium.com/@alexkeila/analysis-of-the-weather-from-brazil-in-the-year-2021-9b28c5c839e).


This repository consists of only one file: a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/alexkeila/udacity_data_science_nanodegree/blob/main/Project%20-%20Write%20a%20Data%20Science%20Blog%20Post.ipynb) with all the steps of my Data Science Project

All code are in a way that anyone can run all cells in order and everything should work fine!!

I used a dataset about weather data from Brazil to answer some questions. All the details are very well documented and easy to read inside the notebook.

I followed the logical steps from CRISP-DM, skiping some parts that were not interesting or not needed for this project.

1. Data Understanding and Collecting
2. Data Preparation
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Presentation of the results/visualizations (Data Viz and Storytelling)
