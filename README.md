# Data Science Nanodegree - Project 4: Dog Breed Classifier (Capstone Project)

This project is related to the Data Science Nanodegree on Udacity (https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd025/dashboard/overview)

I have also written a post at Medium describing this project and the results. It can be accessed [here](https://medium.com/@alexkeila/show-me-your-dog-and-i-will-tell-you-its-breed-957260b18c2f).

This repository consists of only one file: a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/alexkeila/udacity_data_science_nanodegree_project_4/blob/main/Project%20-%20Dog%20Breed%20Classifier.ipynb) with all the steps of my Data Science Project

All code are in a way that anyone can run all cells in order and everything should work fine!!
