# Data Science Nanodegree - Project 4: Dog Breed Classifier (Capstone Project)

This project is related to the Data Science Nanodegree on Udacity (https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd025/dashboard/overview)

This repository consists of only one file: a [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/alexkeila/udacity_data_science_nanodegree_project_4/blob/main/Project%20-%20Dog%20Breed%20Classifier.ipynb) with all the steps of my Data Science Project

All code are in a way that anyone can run all cells in order and everything should work fine!!
